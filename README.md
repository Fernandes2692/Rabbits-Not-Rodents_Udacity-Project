![](images/rabbit_not_rodent.png) 

This project is the first of four, part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. 

The project aims to follow the CRISP-DM process, exhibit technical skills and communicate insights by way of a blog post. 

The topic of this project was chosen as a personal interest but also to raise awareness on the health of the UK's third most common pet. 

The following libraries are used: 

-  Pandas
-  NumPy
-  Matplotlib 
-  Seaborn
 

The data in this project was collated from research by O'Neill, D. G. in "Morbidity and Mortality of Domestic Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) Under Primary Veterinary Care in England in 2013". Dataset: https://rvc-repository.worktribe.com/output/1382109/morbidity-and-mortality-of-domestic-rabbits-oryctolagus-cuniculus-under-primary-veterinary-care-in-england-in-2013
